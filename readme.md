# Shows Assistant
This project is created because it is time-consuming for me to navigate [TVMaze.com's website](http://www.tvmaze.com/) to create a calendar for the tv show's episodes airing schedule.

## Features
1. You can generate an .ics file for the schedule of your favorite show's episodes that can be imported to your google calendar
2. Working on it...

## Installation 
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/isaiahgcruz/laravel-shows-assistant.git`
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Edit `.env` file
5. Run `php artisan migrate` or `php artisan migrate --seed`
6. Run `php artisan key:generate`
7. Enable the site or use `php artisan serve`

## Thanks to
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [TVMaze](http://www.tvmaze.com/) for their [API](http://api.tvmaze.com/)
